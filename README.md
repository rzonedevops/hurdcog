# HurdCog: OpenCog-Powered GNU Hurd Cognitive AGI-OS

**Project:** HurdCog - The World's First Cognitive AGI Operating System  
**Version:** 2.1 - Production Ready with Complete Testing & Documentation  
**Status:** Phase 6 Complete ✅

## Overview

**HurdCog** represents a fundamental breakthrough in operating system design: the integration of OpenCog's AGI framework with GNU Hurd's microkernel architecture to create the world's first **cognitive AGI operating system**.

Unlike traditional operating systems that execute fixed algorithms, HurdCog **learns**, **reasons**, and **adapts**. The system continuously improves its performance, predicts problems before they occur, and optimizes itself based on learned patterns.

**🎉 ALL PHASES COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY WITH RIGOROUS TESTING**

## 🧬 NEW: Master Control Dashboard

**Real-time monitoring and management interface for the Cognitive Fusion Reactor!**

```bash
# Quick Start - Launch the dashboard
cd cogkernel
./start-dashboard.sh
```

**Access:** http://localhost:8080/dashboard

**Features:**
- 📊 Real-time metrics monitoring (AtomSpace, ECAN, Neural-Symbolic, Distributed Mesh, Meta-Cognition)
- ⚡ All 6 phase implementation status tracking
- 🧮 5D cognitive tensor visualization
- 📜 Live system event log
- 🎛️ Interactive controls (refresh, diagnostics, reports)
- 🔌 REST API for programmatic access

**See:** [FUSION_REACTOR_QUICK_START.md](FUSION_REACTOR_QUICK_START.md) | [cogkernel/MASTER_CONTROL_DASHBOARD.md](cogkernel/MASTER_CONTROL_DASHBOARD.md)

## What Makes HurdCog Different?

**Traditional OS:**
- Fixed algorithms
- Manual configuration
- Reactive to problems
- Static behavior

**HurdCog AGI-OS:**
- Learning algorithms (OpenCog AtomSpace)
- Self-configuration (PLN reasoning)
- Predictive adaptation (Pattern mining)
- Continuous evolution (ECAN attention)

## Core Vision

Transform GNU Hurd from a traditional microkernel OS into a **cognitive AGI operating system** that:
- **Learns** from experience and improves over time
- **Reasons** about problems using probabilistic logic
- **Predicts** future needs and optimizes proactively
- **Self-diagnoses** and **self-heals** system issues
- **Adapts** continuously to changing conditions
- **Explains** its decisions and actions

## OpenCog as the Cognitive Core

HurdCog implements **OpenCog as the central nervous system** of the operating system. Every system operation is mediated through cognitive services:

### How It Works

```
Application Request
       ↓
Cognitive Services Layer (learns, reasons, optimizes)
       ↓
OpenCog AtomSpace (stores knowledge, patterns, state)
       ↓
GNU Hurd Microkernel (executes decisions)
       ↓
Hardware
```

### Key Cognitive Capabilities

1. **Cognitive Process Management**: Learns process behavior, predicts resource needs
2. **Cognitive Memory Management**: Predicts page access, optimizes allocation
3. **Cognitive IPC Routing**: Learns communication patterns, optimizes routing
4. **Self-Healing**: Diagnoses problems and applies fixes automatically
5. **Predictive Optimization**: Anticipates needs and optimizes proactively

### Example: The System Learns

```scheme
;; Day 1: System observes your workflow
(record-event "compile" "9:15 AM" "cpu: 80%")
(record-event "test" "9:17 AM" "disk: high")

;; Day 3: System learns the pattern
(learned-pattern
  "morning-development-cycle"
  "compile -> test every 2 minutes"
  confidence: 0.85)

;; Day 5: System optimizes proactively
(predict "compile-starting" "9:15 AM")
(optimize "pre-allocate memory" "keep compiler in RAM")
(result "40% faster compile time")
```

## Getting Started

### For Users - Experience Cognitive Computing

```bash
# Boot HurdCog with cognitive features enabled
grub> boot /boot/gnumach -- /hurd/startup --cognitive

# Your system will now:
# - Learn your usage patterns
# - Optimize itself automatically
# - Predict and prevent problems
# - Explain its decisions
```

### For Developers - Build Cognitive Components

```c
#include <cogkernel/hurd-atomspace-bridge.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize cognitive interface
    hurd_cognitive_init();
    hurd_cognitive_register("my-server");
    
    // Your server is now cognitive-aware!
    // It can learn, reason, and adapt
    
    // Report events to learn from
    hurd_cognitive_add_event(&event);
    
    // Query for optimization suggestions
    hurd_cognitive_get_optimization(&opt);
}
```

See the [Cognitive Services API Guide](docs/COGNITIVE_SERVICES_API.md) for details.
