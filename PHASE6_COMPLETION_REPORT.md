### Best Practices

1. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component thoroughly before integration
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking prevents regression
3. **Documentation-First**: Write documentation before implementation to clarify design
4. **Real Data Testing**: Use real-world scenarios, not just synthetic test cases
