# Basic Knowledge

Before diving in, you should learn basic operating system architecture (Yes, really). You needn't go through all of these, but they're very enjoyable if you want to.

## Operating Systems Basics

* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) - Good, free, self-paced online courses about operating systems.
* [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) - An excellent book on operating systems.
* [[!wikipedia Advanced_Programming_in_the_Unix_Environment]] - May help you grasp UNIX & POSIX standards.
* [Operating Systems](http://www.deitel.com/Books/OperatingSystems/OperatingSystems3e/tabid/1711/Default.aspx) - A well praised book on the subject.
* [Operating System Concepts](https://www.os-book.com/OS9/) - Another well praised book.
* [Modern Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Operating_Systems) - This book has achieved world-wide praise. Of course [the cat-v.org people don't like it](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/andy_tanenbaum).

## GNU/Hurd System Architecture
You may want to start reading a [[quick overview|overview]] of how the GNU/Hurd system
starts, and thus how it is structured. Also see our [[FAQ]]

### Capabilities
  * [[Capabilities|capability]]
  * [[!wikipedia Capability-based_security]] (Wikipedia)
  * [What is a Capability, Anyway?](https://archive.is/20130112225523/http://www.eros-os.org/essays/capintro.html)
  * [Capability Theory by Sound Bytes](http://www.cap-lore.com/CapTheory/)
  * [What Are Capabilities?](http://habitatchronicles.com/2017/05/what-are-capabilities/)

In the Hurd, a capability is represented by a [[Mach port|microkernel/mach/port]].

# Specific Components

The GNU/Hurd system is composed of the Hurd servers running on top of the
GNU Mach microkernel. Mach only handles scheduling tasks and threads, memory
management, and message passing. Mig is used to abstract RPCs on top of Mach's
message passing. Eventually, the Hurd servers and Unix processes discuss with
each other using these RPCs.

Depending on your background, you may want to start reading the documentation
from userlandish interfaces (Hurd) or from the microkernel itself (Mach).

  * [IRC Logs](http://richtlijn.be/~larstiq/hurd/)

The IRC logs contain wealth of information.  Many topics have been covered before in the IRC logs.  You can use wget to
download all of the logs and grep for the information that you want (~100MB):

     wget --mirror --no-parent -A "hurd-*" -e robots=off http://richtlijn.be/~larstiq/hurd/
