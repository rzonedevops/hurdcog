Current issues with copyright assignments:

* David Michael never started the process.
* Kalle Olavi Niemitalo ([contribution](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?48930) [contribution](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?49056)) [does not want to assign copyright](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2016-10/msg00069.html)
* Olaf Buddenhagen, faced with process issues, gave up around 2016 july 23rd.
* Brent Baccala (cases #1160318 #1497319): does not want to assign all past+future changes, would rather provide code under a BSD licence, or assign copyright separately for each contribution (request-assign.changes).
* Luca Dariz (case #1803259): process ongoing, sent form on 2022 Feb 1st, got answer on Feb 11th, pending completion.
* Various main contributors consider copyright assignment an unnecessary burden, the Hurd being considered as never-to-be-key-software.
