SMP stands for Symmetric multiprocessing, which is a computer that has numerous
identical processors connected to a single shared main memory.  All processors
are controlled by one single operating system, and each processor can access all
devices.  Operating systems with SMP can provide more performance, but it is not
trivial to do so.  It is a little like having a packed board meeting.  More
people in the room potentially means more can get done, but only one person can
speak at a time.  Scheduling everyone to speak can be quite an involved task.



     NOTE: Many of the veteran Hurd developers consider this task too large for a Google summer of code project.

# Current Status

As of September 2024, the SMP support is implemented for i386 with
working internet, because it boots with only one cpu in the default
processor set.  The slave processors are temporarily disabled until
they can be safely used per task.  We are unable to turn on the full
set at boot time due to race bugs.  Debian Hurd provides SMP enabled
GNU Mach kernels.

# How to test the current SMP support

The easiest way to test the SMP support, is via the [[qemu
guide|https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/qemu.html]].
Once you have the Hurd running you can build an SMP enabled GNU Mach.

	$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/hurd/gnumach.git
	$ cd gnumach
	$ autoreconf -i
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ ../configure --enable-ncpus=4 --enable-apic --enable-kdb --disable-linux-groups
	$ make gnumach.gz
	$ su
    # mv /boot/gnumach-1.8-486.gz /boot/gnumach-1.8-486.gz.bak
    # cp gnumach.gz /boot/gnumach-1.8-486.gz

You may optionally update `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` change `hd0` to `wd0`
and add `console=com0`

	/boot/gnumach-1.8-486.gz root=part:2:device:wd0 console=com0

update `/etc/fstab` and update `wd0` instead of `hd0`.

    /dev/wd0s2      /               ext2    defaults        0       1
    /dev/wd0s1      none            swap    sw              0       0

You can shutdown via `/sbin/poweroff`.

start qemu with `-smp 4` and add `-nographic` if you want to use `com0`.

	$ qemu-system-i386 -M q35,accel=kvm -smp 4 -m 2G -net  \
	user,hostfwd=tcp::2223-:22 -net nic -hda debian-hurd-VERSION.img \
	-nographic

To test smp:

	$ sudo /path/to/smp /bin/bash
	$ stress -c 7

smp.c source can be found
[[here|https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2024-02/msg00088.html]].

# What was done to get the 32-bit SMP support

The GNU Mach source code includes many special cases for multiprocessor,
controlled  by #if NCPUS > 1 macro.

But this support is very limited:

- GNU Mach don't detect CPUs in runtime: The number of CPUs must be hardcoded in
compilation time.  The number of cpus is set in `mach_ncpus` configuration
variable, set to 1 by default, in configfrag.ac file. This variable will
generate `NCPUS` macro, which is used by gnumach to control the special cases
for multiprocessor.  If `NCPUS` > 1, then gnumach will enable multiprocessor
support, with the number of cpus set by the user in mach_ncpus
variable. Otherwise, SMP will be disabled.

- The special cases to multicore in gnumach source code have never been tested,
  so these can contain many errors. Furthermore, these special case are
  incomplete: many functions, such as `cpu_number()` or `intel_startCPU()` aren't
  written.
  
- GNU Mach doesn't initialize the processor with the proper options for
  multiprocessing. For this reason, the current support is only multithread and
  not real multiprocessor support.

-  Many drivers included in Hurd aren't thread-safe, and these could crash in a
   SMP environment. So, it's necessary to isolate this drivers, to avoid
   concurrency problems.


### Solution

To solve this, we need to implement some routines to detect the number of
processors, assign an identifier to each processor, and configure the lapic and
IPI support. These routines must be executed during Mach boot.

> "Really, all the support you want to get from the hardware is just getting the
> number of processors, initializing them, and   support for interprocessor
> interrupts (IPI) for signaling." - Samuel Thibault
> [link](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2018-08/msg00071.html)

> "The process scheduler probably already has the support. What is missing is
the hardware driver for SMP: enumeration and initialization." - Samuel Thibault
[link](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2018-08/msg00083.html)

The current necessary functions are `cpu_number()` (in kern/cpu_number.h) and
`intel_startCPU()`.  Another non-critical function, is `cpu_control()`
[*Reference*](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/gnumach-doc/Processor-Control.html#Processor-Control)

Other interesting files are `pmap.c` and `sched_prim.c` We also
have to build an isolated environment to execute the non-thread-safe drivers.

> performance-sensitive, so big locks would be enough." - Samuel Thibault

### Task list

1. DONE Implement a routine to detect and identify the processors

   This routine must check the number of processors, initialize the lapic of BSP
   (the master processor), and assign a kernel ID for each processor. This kernel
   ID does not have to be equal to the APIC ID. The relation kernel/APIC can be
   settled with an array, where the kernel ID is the index, and the APIC contains
   the data.  GNU Mach can derive the list of processors from memory, reading from
   ACPI table, or from MP table. However, MP table is deprecated in most modern
   CPUs, so it is preferable to use ACPI table for this.

   The tasks to do for this are:
   
   - Detect the number of processors
   
      - Create a array indexed by kernel ID, which sets a relation with APIC ID.
   
   - Initialize the lapic of BSP
   
   - Initialize IOAPIC

      This routine could be called from `i386at_init()`
      (i386/i386at/model_dep.c). This function will call the functions which
      initialize the lapic and the ioapic.
   
        **NOTE**: This routine must be executed before `intel_startCPU()` or other routines.
   
   - **How to find APIC table**
   
       To find APIC table, we can read
          RSDT table [RSDT reference](http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI%206_2_A_Sept29.pdf#G10.1358180).
          To get the address of RSDT, we need to read RDSP table. We can get the
          RSDP table by this [RDSP
          reference](http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI%206_2_A_Sept29.pdf#G10.1357698)
          Once we have the RSDT table, we need to read *Entry* field, and search the pointer to
          the APIC table in the array referenced in this field.
        
       We can find an example about reading ACPI table in X15 OS:
          [Reference](https://github.com/richardbraun/x15/blob/0c0e2a02a42a8161e1b8dc1e1943fe5057ecb3a3/arch/x86/machine/acpi.c#L576)
        
   - We need to initialize the `machine_slot` of each processor (currently only initializes cpu0).
      The `machine_slot` has this structure. [Reference](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/0d490ef21c156907f3f26a6cdc00842f462a877a/include/mach/machine.h#L68):
   
   >  `struct machine_slot { /*boolean_t*/` <br/>
   > `integer_t	is_cpu;` <br/> 
   >  `/* is there a cpu in this slot? */ ` <br/>
   >  `cpu_type_t cpu_type;	/* type of cpu */`  <br/>
   > `cpu_subtype_t cpu_subtype;	/* subtype of cpu */`                                       <br/> 
   > `/*boolean_t*/  integer_t	running;	/* is cpu running */` <br/>
   > `integer_t	cpu_ticks[CPU_STATE_MAX];                         	integer_t` <br/>
   >  `clock_freq;	/* clock interrupt frequency */                       };`      <br/>
   
   
     We can find an example of initialization in this [link:](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/0d490ef21c156907f3f26a6cdc00842f462a877a/i386/i386at/model_dep.c#L612)
   
     This modification also involve the redefinition of `NCPUS`, which must be set
     to the maximum **possible** number of processors.  We can do this by modifying
     `configfrag.ac`, with this:
   
   > `# Multiprocessor support is still broken.` <br/>
   > `AH_TEMPLATE([MULTIPROCESSOR], [set things up for a uniprocessor])` <br/>
   > `mach_ncpus=2` <br/>
   > `AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED([NCPUS], [$mach_ncpus], [number of CPUs])` </br>
   > `[if [$mach_ncpus` > `-gt 1 ]; then]` <br/>
   > `AC_DEFINE([MULTIPROCESSOR], [1], [set things up for a` > `multiprocessor])`
   > `AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED([NCPUS], [256], [number of CPUs]) ` <br/>
   > `[fi]` <br/>

   - `c_boot_entry()`
      [Link](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/0d490ef21c156907f3f26a6cdc00842f462a877a/i386/i386at/model_dep.c#L529)

  - Example, in X15 OS:
     [Link](https://github.com/richardbraun/x15/blob/d6d90a3276a09da65690b019e985392bf77b53b0/arch/x86/machine/cpu.c#L1114)

   1.1. Implement a `cpu_number()` function.


     This function must return the kernel ID of the processor which is executing the function.  To
     get this, we have to read the local apic memory space, which will show the
     lapic of the current CPU. Reading the lapic, we can get its APIC ID.  Once
     we have the APIC ID of the current CPU, the function will search in the
     Kernel/APIC array until it finds the same APIC ID. Then it will return the
     index (Kernel ID) of this position.

2. DONE Implement a routine to initialize the processors


   This routine will initialize the lapic of each processor and other structures
   needed to run the kernel.  We can find an example of lapic initialization
   here
   [reference](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/b818915f793cd20c5d1e24f668534a9d690f3cc8/lapic.c#L55)
   Also, we can get more information in Chapter 8.4 and 8.11 of Intel
   Developer Guide,
   Volume 3. [link](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/a4/60/325384-sdm-vol-3abcd.pdf)

3. DONE Implement `intel_startCPU()`


   This function will initialize the descriptor tables of the processor specified by the
   parameter, and launch the startup IPI to this processor.  This function will be
   executed during the boot of the kernel (process 0).  The task to do in this function
   are:

  - Initialize the processor descriptor tables
  - Launch Startup IPI to this processor
     We have a current implementation of `intel_startCPU()` in this
   [link](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/smp/i386/i386/mp_desc.c).
   This implementation is based in XNU's `intel_startCPU()`
     [function](https://github.com/nneonneo/osx-10.9-opensource/blob/f5a0b24e4d98574462c8f5e5dfcf0d37ef7e0764/xnu-2422.1.72/osfmk/i386/mp.c#L423)

   We can find explainations about how to raise an IPI in this pages:
   [*Reference 1*](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~cruse/cs630f08/lesson22.ppt),
   [*Reference 2*](https://www.cheesecake.org/sac/smp.html), [*Reference
   3*](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/pub/quaglia/AOSV-traps-interrupts.pdf) We can
   get information about how to raise an IPI in Intel Developer Guide, Volume 3,
   Chapter 10.6

4. Implement another routine to start the processors


   This routine calls to `processor_start()` for each processor, which will start the
   processor using this sequence of calls: [`processor_start(processor_t
   processor)`](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/5d527f532dfba9f2da54555d5fbe585dd458579b/kern/processor.c#L447)
   ->
   [`cpu_start(processor->slot_num)`](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/5d527f532dfba9f2da54555d5fbe585dd458579b/i386/i386/mp_desc.c#L335)
   ->
   [`intel_startCPU(cpu)`](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/5d527f532dfba9f2da54555d5fbe585dd458579b/i386/i386/mp_desc.c#L180)

   These articles shows some annotations about how to do the AP Startup:

   - [Reference1](https://wiki.osdev.org/Symmetric_Multiprocessing#AP_startup),
   - [Reference2](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16368043/7077301) (...)

      After implement IPI support, It's recommended reimplement `machine_idle()`,
   `machine_relax ()`, `halt_cpu()` and `halt_all_cpus()` using IPI.
   - [reference](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/0d490ef21c156907f3f26a6cdc00842f462a877a/i386/i386at/model_dep.c#L201)
   - Also in `ast_check.c`, we have to implement both functions, using
   IPI
   [Reference](https://github.com/AlmuHS/GNUMach_SMP/blob/master/i386/i386/ast_check.c)


   This functions must force the processors to check if there are any AST
   signal, and we ought to keep in the mind the following irc chat:
