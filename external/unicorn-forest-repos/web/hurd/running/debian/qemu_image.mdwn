[[!meta title="Debian's QEMU Image"

There is a QEMU image with [[Debian GNU/Hurd|debian]] pre-installed available
at <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.gz>.

Usage:

* Install qemu-kvm via your distribution's package manager (it might just be named qemu)
* Download the image, unpack it, and run it:

<!-- Code snippits embedded in lists are garbage. Do not remove this comment. -->

	$ wget https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.gz
	$ tar -xz < debian-hurd.img.tar.gz
	$ kvm -m 1G -drive cache=writeback,file=$(echo debian-hurd-*.img) -no-reboot -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22 -net nic,model=e1000

* Log in as root (the root password is empty)
* Set up a root password with `passwd`

* update the system with `apt update && apt upgrade`

* Log in as demo (the demo password is empty)
* Set up a demo password with `passwd`

* You can also create another non-root user with `adduser <username>`
* and set the non-root user password with `passwd <username>`
* and add the non-root user to the sudo group via `gpasswd -a <user> sudo`

* logout via `logout`

Optionally you may use `--curses` to keep your keyboard layout. If need be modprobe kvm_amd, kvm intel and kvm to get kvm support (which is much, much faster).

Note that if you do not have a command named `kvm`, you can try something across the lines of:

	$ qemu-system-i386 --enable-kvm -drive cache=writeback,file=$(echo debian-hurd-*.img) -net user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22 -net nic,model=e1000

Or, if your machine does not allow for KVM acceleration, omit `--enable-kvm` from the command.

If you have troubles extracting the image, you can use
the [gz version](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.gz),
the [zip version](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.zip),
or even the [plain version](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/latest/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img) (5GiB!)
