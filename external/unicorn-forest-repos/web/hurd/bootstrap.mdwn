# State at the beginning of the bootstrap

Also consider reading about [[Serverboot V2|open_issues/serverbootv2]], which is
a new bootstrap proposal.

After initializing itself, GNU Mach sets up tasks for the various bootstrap
translators (which were loader by the GRUB bootloader). It notably makes
variables replacement on their command lines and boot script function calls (see
the details in `gnumach/kern/boot_script.c`). For instance, the GRUB
bootloader can have the following typical configuration:

    multiboot       /boot/gnumach-1.8-486-dbg.gz root=device:hd1 console=com0
    module          /hurd/pci-arbiter.static pci-arbiter
                    --host-priv-port='${host-port}' \
                    --device-master-port='${device-port}' \
                    --next-task='${acpi-task}' \
                    '$(pci-task=task-create)' '$(task-resume)'
    module          /hurd/acpi.static acpi \
                    --next-task='${disk-task}' \
                    '$(acpi-task=task-create)'
    module          /hurd/rumpdisk.static rumpdisk \
                    --next-task='${fs-task}' \
                    '$(disk-task=task-create)'
    module          /hurd/ext2fs.static ext2fs --readonly \
                    --multiboot-command-line='${kernel-command-line}' \
                    --exec-server-task='${exec-task}' -T typed '${root}' \
                    '$(fs-task=task-create)'
    module          /lib/ld.so.1 exec /hurd/exec '$(exec-task=task-create)'


GNU Mach will first make the `$(task-create)` function calls, and thus create
a series of tasks for the various modules, and assign to the `pci-task`,
`acpi-task`, `disk-task`, and `fs-task` variables the task ports for each of
them. None of these tasks is started yet.

It will then replace the variables (`${foo}`), i.e.

* `${kernel-command-line}` with its own command line (`root=device:hd1 console=com0`),
* `${host-port}` with a reference to the GNU Mach host port,
* `${device-port}` with a reference to the GNU Mach device port,
* `${acpi-task}` with a reference to the acpi task port, and similarly for all other tasks.
* `${root}` with `device:hd1`

This typically results in:

    task loaded: pci-arbiter --host-priv-port=1 --device-master-port=2 --next-task=3
    task loaded: acpi --next-task=1
    task loaded: rumpdisk --next-task=1
    task loaded: ext2fs --readonly --multiboot-command-line=root="device:sd1 console=com0" --exec-server-task=1 -T typed device:sd1
    task loaded: exec /hurd/exec


(You will have noticed that `/hurd/exec` is not run directly, but through
`ld.so.1`: Mach only knows to run statically-linked ELF binaries, so we could
either load `/hurd/exec.static` directly, or load the dynamic loader `ld.so.1`
and tell it to load `/hurd/exec`, which will be readable once `ext2fs.static` is
started)

GNU Mach will eventually make the `$(task-resume)` function calls, and thus
resume the `pci-arbiter` task only.

Usually the bootstrap ports of translators is used when starting them, see
`fshelp_start_translator_long`: the parent translator starts the child and sets
its bootstrap port. The parent then waits for the child to call `fsys_startup`
on the bootstrap port, for the child to provide its control port, and for the
parent to provide the FS node that the child is translator for.

But here when `pci-arbiter` initializes itself, it notices that its bootstrap
port is nul (it is started by the kernel, not a filesystem) so it knows that it
is alone and can only rely on the kernel.  It initializes itself and parses the
arguments, and since it is given a `next-task`, it uses `task_set_special_port`
to pass a send right to its own control port to that next task (here `acpi`) as
bootstrap port, and uses `task_resume` to start it.

Similarly, `acpi` initializes itself, gives a send right to `rumpdisk` and
starts it.

`rumpdisk` does the same, so that eventually `ext2fs` starts, with all of
`pci-arbiter`, `acpi` and `rumpdisk` ready to reply to `device_open` requests on
the `pci`, `acpi`, and disks device names.

Now that `ext2fs` starts, a dance begin between the remaining bootstrap
processes: `ext2fs`, `exec`, `startup`, `proc`, and `auth`. Indeed, there are
a few dependencies between them: `exec` needs `ext2fs` working to be able to
start `startup`, `proc` and `auth`, and `ext2fs` needs to register itself to
`startup`, `proc` and `auth` so as to appear as a normal process, running under
uid 0.

They will register to each other the following way:

* Between `ext2fs` and `startup`: `startup` calls `fsys_init`, to
provide `ext2fs` with `proc` and `auth` ports.
* Between `startup` and `proc`: `proc` just calls `startup_procinit` to hand
over a `proc` port and get `auth` and `priv` ports.
* Between `startup` and `auth`: `auth` calls `startup_authinit` to hand over an
`auth` port and get a `proc` port, then calls `startup_essential_task` to notify
`startup` that the boot can proceed.
* For the series of translators before `ext2fs`, each task calls `fsys_startup`
to pass over the control port of `ext2fs` to the previous task (instead of
its own control port, which is useless for it). This is typically done in the
`S_fsys_startup` stub, simply forwarding it. It also calls `fsys_init` to
pass over the `proc` and `auth` ports. Again, this is typically done in the
`S_fsys_init` stub, simply forwarding them.

With that in mind, the dance between the bootstrap translators is happening as
described in the next sections.

# ext2fs initialization

ext2fs's `main` function starts by calling `diskfs_init_main`.

`diskfs_init_main` parses the ext2fs command line with `argp_parse`, to record
the parameters set up by the kernel. It makes sure to have a working stdout by
opening the Mach console.

Since the multiboot command line is available, `diskfs_init_main` sets the
ext2fs bootstrap port to `MACH_PORT_NULL`: it is the bootstrap filesystem which
will be in charge of dancing with the exec and startup translator.

`diskfs_init_main` then initializes the libdiskfs library and spawns a thread to
manage libdiskfs RPCs. It also notices that the filesystem is given a kernel
command line, i.e. this is the bootstrap filesystem.

ext2fs continues its initialization: creating a pager, opening the
hypermetadata, opening the root inode to be set as root by libdiskfs.

ext2fs then calls `diskfs_startup_diskfs` to really run the startup, implemented
by the libdiskfs library.

# libdiskfs bootstrap

Since this is the bootstrap filesystem, `diskfs_startup_diskfs` calls
`diskfs_start_bootstrap`.

`diskfs_start_bootstrap` starts by creating a open port on itself for the
current and root directory, all other processes will inherit it.

`diskfs_start_bootstrap` does have a port on the exec task, so it can dance with
it. It calls `start_execserver` that sets the bootstrap port of the exec task
to a port of the `diskfs_execboot_class`, and resumes the exec task.
`diskfs_start_bootstrap` then waits for `execstarted`.

# exec bootstrap

exec's `main` function starts and calls `task_get_bootstrap_port` to get
its bootstrap port and `getproc` to get a port on the proc translator (thus
`MACH_PORT_NULL` at this point since the proc translator is not started yet).

exec initializes the trivfs library, and eventually calls `trivfs_startup` on
its bootstrap port.

`trivfs_startup` creates a control port for the exec translator, and calls
`fsys_startup` on the bootstrap port to notify ext2fs that it is ready, give it
its exec control port, and get back a port on the underlying node for the exec
translator (we want to make it show up on `/servers/exec`).

# libdiskfs taking back control

`diskfs_execboot_fsys_startup` is thus called. It calls `dir_lookup` on
`/servers/exec` to return the underlying node for the exec translator, and
stores the `exec` control port in `diskfs_exec_ctl`. It can then signal `execstarted`.

`diskfs_start_bootstrap` thus takes back control, It calls `fsys_getroot` on the
control port of exec, and uses `dir_lookup` and `file_set_translator` to attach
it to `/servers/exec`.

`diskfs_start_bootstrap` then looks for which startup process to run. It may
be specified on the multiboot command line, but otherwise it will default to
`/hurd/startup`.

Now that exec is up and running, the `startup` process can be created with
`exec_exec`. `diskfs_start_bootstrap` takes a lot of care in this: this is
the first unix-looking process, it notably inherits the root directory and
current working directory initialized above, it gets stdin/out/err on the mach
console. It is passed as bootstrap port a port from the `diskfs_control_class`.

`diskfs_start_bootstrap` is complete, we are back to `diskfs_startup_diskfs`,
which checks whether ext2fs was given a bootstrap port, i.e. whether
the rumpdisk translator was started before ext2fs. If so, it
calls `diskfs_call_fsys_startup` which creates a new control port and passes
it do a call to `fsys_startup` on the bootstrap port, so rumpdisk gets access
to the ext2fs filesystem. Rumpdisk however does not return any `realnode` port,
since we are not exposing the ext2fs filesystem in rumpdisk, but rather the
converse. TODO: Rumpdisk forwards this `fsys_startup` call to pci-arbiter, so
the latter also gets access to the ext2fs filesystem.

# startup 

startup's `main` function starts and calls `task_get_bootstrap_port` to get its
bootstrap port, i.e. the control port of ext2fs, and `fsys_getpriv` on it to get
the host privileged port and device master port. It
clears the bootstrap port so children do not inherit it. It sets itself up with
output on the Mach console, and wires itself against swapping. It requests
notification for ext2fs translator dying to detect it and print a warning in
case that happens during boot. It creates a `startup` port which it will get
RPCs on.

startup can then complete the unixish initialization, and run `/hurd/proc` and
`/hurd/auth`, giving them as bootstrap port the `startup` port.

# proc

proc's `main` function starts. It initializes itself, and calls
`task_get_bootstrap_port` to get a port on startup. It can then call
`startup_procinit` on it to pass it the proc port that will represent the startup
task, and get ports on the auth server, the host privileged port, and device
master port.

Eventually, proc calls `startup_essential_task` to tell startup that it is
ready.

# auth

auth's `main` function starts. It creates the initial root auth handle (all
permissions allowed). It calls `task_get_bootstrap_port` to get a port on
startup.  It can then call `startup_authinit` on it to pass the initial root auth
handle, and get a port on the proc server. It can then register itself to proc.

Eventually, auth calls `startup_essential_task` to tell startup that it is ready.

# startup getting back control

startup notices initialization of auth and proc from `S_startup_procinit` and
`S_startup_authinit`. Once both have been called, it calls `launch_core_servers`.

`launch_core_servers` starts by calling `startup_procinit_reply` to actually
reply to the `startup_procinit` RPC with a port on auth.

`launch_core_servers` then tells proc that the bootstrap processes are
important, and how they relate to each other.

`launch_core_servers` then calls `install_as_translator` to show up in the
filesystem on `/servers/startup`.

`launch_core_servers` calls `startup_authinit_reply` to actually reply to the
`startup_authinit` RPC with a port on proc. 

`launch_core_servers` eventually calls `fsys_init` on its bootstrap port, to
give ext2fs the proc and auth ports.

diskfs' `diskfs_S_fsys_init` thus gets called. It first replies to startup, so
startup is not stuck in its `fsys_init` call and not able to reply to RPCs. From
then on, startup will be watching for `startup_essential_task` calls from the
various bootstrap processes. 

# libdiskfs taking back control

In diskfs' `diskfs_S_fsys_init`, diskfs now knows that proc and auth are ready,
and can call `exec_init` on the exec port.

# exec getting initialized

exec's `S_exec_init` gets called from the `exec_init` call from ext2fs. Exec can
register itself with proc, and eventually call `startup_essential_task` to tell
startup that it is ready.

# back to libdiskfs initialization

It also calls `fsys_init`
on its bootstrap port, i.e. rumpdisk.

# rumpdisk getting initialized

rumpdisk's `trivfs_S_fsys_init` gets called from the `fsys_init` call from
ext2fs. It calls `fsys_init` on its bootstrap port.

# acpi getting initialized

acpi's `trivfs_S_fsys_init` gets called from the `fsys_init` call from
rumpdisk. It calls `fsys_init` on its bootstrap port.

# pci-arbiter getting initialized

pci-arbiter's `trivfs_S_fsys_init` gets called from the `fsys_init` call from
rumpdisk.

It gets the root node of ext2fs, sets all common ports, and install
itself in the ext2fs FS as translator for `/servers/bus/pci`.

It eventually calls `startup_essential_task` to tell startup that it is ready,
and requests shutdown notifications.

# back to acpi initialization

It gets the root node of ext2fs, sets all common ports, and install
itself in the ext2fs FS as translator for `/servers/acpi`.

It eventually calls `startup_essential_task` to tell startup that it is ready,
and requests shutdown notifications.

# back to rumpdisk initialization

It gets the root node of ext2fs, sets all common ports, and install
itself in the ext2fs FS as translator for `/dev/disk`.

It eventually calls `startup_essential_task` to tell startup that it is ready,
and requests shutdown notifications.

# back to libdiskfs initialization

It initializes the default proc and auth ports to be given to processes.

It calls `startup_essential_task` on the startup port to tell startup that
it is ready.

Eventually, it calls `_diskfs_init_completed` to finish its initialization, and
notably call `startup_request_notification` to get notified by startup when the
system is shutting down.

# startup monitoring bootstrap progress

As mentioned above, the different essential tasks (pci-arbiter, acpi, rumpdisk, ext2fs, proc, auth, exec)
call `startup_essential_task` when they are ready. startup's
`S_startup_essential_task` function thus gets called each time, and startup
records each of them as essential, monitoring their death to crash the whole
system.

Once all of proc, auth, exec have called `startup_essential_task`, startup
replies to their respective RPCs, so they actually start working altogether. It
also calls `init_stdarrays` which sets the initial values of the standard exec data, and `frob_kernel_process` to plug the kernel task into the picture.
It eventually calls `launch_something`, which "launches
something", which by default is `/libexec/runsystem`, but if that can not be
found, launches a shell instead, so the user can fix it.
